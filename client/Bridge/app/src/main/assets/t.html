Will send over a draft by the end of the day.<br>
I'm having trouble accessing XYZ's site. Might have to get back to you tomorrow. Is that okay? <br>
I have a lab report and a problem set due on the same day. Could I have an extension till Wednesday?<br>
I'm not feeling well today and will take the afternoon off. Please do let me know if you need me tomorrow.<br>
Wanted to clarify something with you. Could you call after 3?<br>
